# Lab Report 1: Remote Access and The File System
---
## Installing VS Code
To start working on the file system and acessing the UCSD ieng6 server, you first need visual studio code,
an IDE that will help us use it's terminal for SSH and SCP commands, but also let us edit our Java program
that we will upload to the server.

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

After you are finished installing VSCode, we can get starting with remoting connecting.
